<h3>What is GRC?</h3>
GRC stands for Governance, Risk and Compliance.
<br>According to IBM [https://www.ibm.com/topics/grc], GRC is an organizational strategy to manage governance and risks while maintaining compliance with industry and government regulations.
<br>
<p>Governance is the set of rules, policies, and processes that ensures corporate activities are aligned to support business goals. It encompasses ethics, resource management, accountability, and management controls.</p>
<p>Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling financial, legal, strategic, and security risks to an organization. To reduce risk, an organization needs to apply resources to minimize, monitor and control the impact of negative events while maximizing positive events.</p>
<p>Compliance involves adhering to rules, policies, standards, and laws determined by industries and/or government agencies. Non-compliance could cost an organization in terms of poor performance, costly mistakes, fines, penalties and lawsuits.</p>

<h3>Let's talk about basic RISK terms</h3>
<li>Vulnerability: A weakness in a system or environment with potential to be exploited by an attacker.</li>
<li>Threat: Possibility of a vulnerability to be exploited (and ways it could be exploited.</li>
<li>Risk: Likelihood of threat occuring and potential damage it would cause.</li>
<li>Law: Laws are specific rules enforced by a government to dictate the correct & legal actions that must be taken.</li>
<li>Regulations: They are created to act as the accepted method of following through on a certain action. This is a blanket term which can be used to refer to laws but may also be used to refer to contractual obligations and third party regulatory frameworks.</li>
<li>Policy: This is set of rules that govern the way in which certain processes should be carried out. NB: You may be reprimanded by the company for failing to follow a policy but policies by themselves do not typically carry any legal consequences.</li>
<li>Standard: Standards are acceptable way of doing things.</li>
<li>Guideline: Recommended way of completing a process or carrying out a task.</li>
<br>
<h3>METADATA</h3>
What is Metadata? 
<br>
Metadata is data about data. It provides context and meaning to raw data, making it easier to understand and manage.
<br> Common characteristics include: 
<li>Descriptions (e.g., file name, type) </li>
<li>Classifications (e.g., tags, categories)</li> 
<li>Structural details (e.g., data format)</li>

# Introduction to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 

### (5) five core functions:
1. <b>IDENTIFY (ID):</b> This process involves the identification of assets (hardware/software) and they are prioritized based on their classification, criticality, and business value.
2. <b>PROTECT (PR):</b> The assets that has been identified are then protected. Access to systems and assets is controlled, incorporating the principle of Least privileged, remotes access is controlled and well-managed. RBAC role accordingly to the functions of the users.
3.	<b>DETECT (DE):</b> Physical environments, personnel activities, networks, endpoints are all monitored. Monitoring for unauthorized personnel, malicious codes, connections, devices, and software is performed.
4.	<b>RESPOND (RS): </b>There is response plan that must be followed during/after an incident (Incident depends on the event the organization categorized as an incident). All parties involved in the incidence response plan are well trained (table top talks) to prepare them ahead. The incidents are attended to and properly mitigated and documented.
5.	<b>RECOVER (RC): </b>Recovery plan is executed during or after an event. Recovery plans incorporate lessons learned, strategies are updated, Public relations are managed, Reputation after an event is repaired. Recovery activities are communicated to internal stakeholders and executive and management teams

<h3>Discussion of risk-based approach in the context of the NIST CSF. How does this approach help organizations prioritize their cybersecurity efforts? </h3>
<br>
 - A risk-based approach involves the process where you identify the level of risks in an organization and make them the priority for controls, policies, and procedures. Once the high level risks are worked on and reduced to acceptable level, management can focus on the low risks. We can also say the organization risk appetite and tolerance level has to be determined in order to reduce/mitigate the risk.

# Risk assessment 
Risk Assessement is the process used to identify and evaluate risks and its potential effects. To successfully carry out risk assessment, you need to identify the assets and their threats.

### 4 steps involved in risk assessments are: 
1. <b>Identification:</b> Determine critical assets of the technology infrastructure.
2. <b>Assessment:</b> Assess the identified security risks for the identified critical assets. 
3. <b>Mitigation:</b> Determine how to effectively and efficiently allocate time and resources towards risk mitigation
4.	<b>Prevention:</b> Implementation of processes to minimize threats and vulnerabilities from occurring.

# 3 classes of controls and purpose are: 
 
1. <b>Administrative Control:</b> This is a type of control that involves the implementation and enforcement of security policies, rules, procedures, and guidelines by management level. The purpose serves to regulate access to classified information and systems. EG. User awareness training, user access policies, risk management, policy documentation and incident response plan.
2. <b>Physical Control:</b> This is a type of control that organizations take to physically protect their assets. EG. security personnel, access control vestibule (mantrap), and CCTV cameras. The purpose serves to prevent unauthorized access to areas where sensitive information or critical business systems are located.
3. <b>Technical Control:</b> This type of control involves implementation of measures to safeguard organization digital assets. E.g., firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems etc. The purpose is to prevent unauthorized access to digital systems and information by attackers or other malicious actors.

# Risk response options: 
1. Avoidance: Avoiding an activity because the risks outweighs the potential gain
2. Reduction/mitigation: Controls are put in place before undertaking the risk
3. Transfer/Sharing: Risks can be transferred to 3rd party in exchange for payment
4. Acceptance: Risk falls within the organizationâ€™s risk appetite.

# Security Governance
Information Security governance is a set of management activities that establishes key roes and responsibilities, identifies and treat key asset risks and measures key security processes.
